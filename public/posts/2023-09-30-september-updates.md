Hello everyone, I'm Batuhan and today I got the updates on the server that happened in September of 2023. Let's start!

## Website updates
- When I created this website at the August I still was a learner about CSS and becouse of that this website had some design flaws that keeps the users away from this site. [As I mentioned on this issue on Github](https://github.com/B4tuhanY1lmaz/Caesium/issues/1).

Now hopefully our site will look and run much better on all devices.

## New Mods
- To make server special and add more things to explore, I've added the [Structory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structory) and [Structory Towers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structory-towers) mods. When these mods combined with the Terralith world generation that our server uses, it produces pretty nice landscapes and more things to explore.
- Also I'm planning to add the [Simple Voice Chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat) to our server to unlock the ability to talk with other players in-game! For that I have to do some testing and hopefully it'll be ready at the end of this month!

So this was it for this month. Don't forget to joing our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8dAHkxbKPf) and share your builds and discoveries with us.

### Until next time! ðŸ‘‹
