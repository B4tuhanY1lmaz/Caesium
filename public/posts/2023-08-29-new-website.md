Hello everyone, Batuhan here. If you're here from the Discord server well you're already know me but if you don't here is a short about me section.

## Who I am?
- I'm Batuhan Yilmaz and I'm the owner and admin of The Batuhan's Network discord server and also the developer of the website you're currently in. For more information you can check out my personal [blog site](https://www.thebatuhansnetwork.xyz).

We had this SMP server around since summer of 2022 at a tiny VPS owned by CyberGen49. Since than it went down becouse of no activity but we had all these time and effort spend on this server and since it was one of the core parts of our Discord server, I decided to take this SMP up and running again on a better hardware.

To make this happen again I spend nearly 120$Â and brought the server, the VPS for port forwarding and backups and the ```tbnmc.xyz``` domain name for 2 years.

## Why I build a website for an SMP server?
- This is a question that I got asked and the answer is simple. I want to take my Discord server and SMP server public for everyone. Purchasing the domain name was the first step for that and this website is the second one. 

I used NextJS 13 with TailwindCSS
