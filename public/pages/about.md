## The Batuhan's Network SMP
- A cracked SMP server with some tweaks over Vanilla Minecraft.
- Near zero rule experience!
- *And much more!* 

### What's this server?
The Batuhan's Network SMP (shortly tbnmc) is a simple SMP (Survival Multi Player) server that aims to give you a great experience of playing on a survival world with other people. In our world generation we used [Terralith](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terralith) and [Structory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/structory) mods to add more places and landscapes to explore with your friends!

###Â Rules
- Grieving other peoples work or stealing items is forbidden.
