# Caesium
Caesium is a simple website written in NextJS as a website to the [tbnmc.xyz](https://www.tbnmc.xyz) Minecraft server.
Caesium is still under developement and not ready to be used for another server or something but I have plans to make it configurable and customizable to make it usable for everyone.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
